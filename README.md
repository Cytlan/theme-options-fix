# Theme Options Fix
This script fixes the Wordpress Theme Options table when you've been dumb enough to run a search and replace on the table, and now have broken the string encodings in various options.

How to use:
   1. Put this file next to your wp-config.php file
   2. Run it through the command line, or open it in the broser
